# staker


## Objective:

The idea within these project lands in the devlopment of an ERC20 Token BGC. A second smart contract can be found that will have all the token supply of BGC and will distribute 
it to wallet address that stake ETH in it. The object is to apply simple DeFi concepts and while using a decentralized application.

## Instructions:

The app can be find at this URL:

The contracts have been deployed to the kovan test network so in order to stake ETH you should make sure your wallet has some balance before interacting with the dapp.

## Considerations

The dapp should be refreshed after you get a transaction confirmation from your browser in order to reflect your balance.
