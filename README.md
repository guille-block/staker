# staker


## Objective:

The idea within this project lands in the development of an ERC20 Token BGC with its own tokeneconomics. A second smart contract can be found that will have all the token supply of BGC and will distribute 
it as interests to wallet addresses that stake ETH in it. The object is to apply simple DeFi concepts while using a decentralized application.

## Instructions:

The app can be found at this URL:

The contracts have been deployed to the kovan test network so in order to stake ETH you should make sure your wallet has some balance beforehand.

## Considerations

The dapp should be refreshed after you get a transaction confirmation from your browser in order to reflect your balance.
